Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

This project focuses on conducting a sentiment analysis and visualisation of the patterns on a twitter comments dataset obtained from Kaggle. The twitter sentiment analysis dataset provides data on a number of tweets published on the twitter website by users on the topic of video games.

The data from the dataset is processed using data cleaning and tokenization and then plotted into bar graph indicating the frequency of gaming titles used in the tweets and a heatmap of the data is obtained.

A machine learning model using the algorithm of random forest is trained on the dataset and is made to predict the sentiment of the comments in the data. 

The code is written in the python programming language using the python libraries matplotlib, natural language toolkit, seaborn, wordcloud, re, sklearn and pandas.
